      <h1><a id="Frequently-asked-questions" href="#Frequently-asked-questions" class="link-to-headline" aria-label="link to headline">&#x1F517;</a>Frequently asked questions</h1>
<p>There are a couple of questions we have been asked over and over again&#x2026;</p>
<h2><a id="Does-ally-js-support-Internet-Explorer-8-and-below" href="#Does-ally-js-support-Internet-Explorer-8-and-below" class="link-to-headline" aria-label="link to headline">&#x1F517;</a>Does ally.js support Internet Explorer 8 and below?</h2>
<p>The short answer is <em>no</em>. IE8 is too far behind on various APIs to make the existing code work. Additionally, our test system <a href="https://theintern.github.io/">Intern</a> does not run on IE8. Also <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support">Microsoft ended support for IE8 in January 2016</a>.</p>
<p>While ally.js has not been tested to <em>run</em> on IE8, we have made sure that it can be <em>loaded</em> without problems. Since ally.js is compiled to ES5, you will need to load the <a href="https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim/">es5-shim</a> in IE8:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;!--[if lt IE 9]&gt;
  &lt;script src=&quot;node_modules/es5-shim/es5-shim.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src=&quot;node_modules/es5-shim/es5-sham.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2><a id="Do-I-need-ally-js-for-static-websites" href="#Do-I-need-ally-js-for-static-websites" class="link-to-headline" aria-label="link to headline">&#x1F517;</a>Do I need ally.js for static websites?</h2>
<p>Probably not. If you don&apos;t have any interactive widgets on your site, chances are ally.js is not going to do you much good. Except for maybe help <a href="api/index.html#Countering-browser-bugs">get around some non-JavaScript accessibility issues across browsers</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="ally-not-a11y" href="#ally-not-a11y" class="link-to-headline" aria-label="link to headline">&#x1F517;</a>&quot;ally&quot; not &quot;a11y&quot;?</h2>
<p>When the project started in October 2014, it was called &quot;a11y.js&quot;. We didn&apos;t register any domains or grabbed the npm package name - which turned out to be a problem a couple of weeks later. We&apos;re not sad this happened.</p>
<p>&quot;ally&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">phonetic</a> <code>&#xE6;laj</code>) is easier to pronounce than &quot;a11y&quot; (phonetic <code>&#x259; &#x259;l&#x25B;v&#x259;n waj</code>). &quot;a11y&quot; is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym">numeronym</a> and expands to &quot;accessibility&quot;. &quot;ally&quot; has a number of <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ally">definitions</a> ranging from &quot;friend&quot; to &quot;cooperating&quot;, which has a much nicer tone to it.</p>
<h2><a id="Why-was-this-created" href="#Why-was-this-created" class="link-to-headline" aria-label="link to headline">&#x1F517;</a>Why was this created?</h2>
<p>While trying to learn accessibility in general and keyboard navigation in particular, it became obvious that the web was not making things very easy. Tutorials were missing important pieces - coherence and a focus on the developer usually wasn&apos;t a thing. Examples looked like their JavaScript was written in the 90s, or depended on jQuery, or simply skipped the meaty parts.</p>
<p>We weren&apos;t able to use any of the existing solutions. We also weren&apos;t going to just copy paste other people&apos;s code into our applications and let the cycle repeat. We wanted to create the basis for accessibility experts and web developers to <em>collaborate</em> in a way that might help everyone.</p>
<h2><a id="Ultimate-goal" href="#Ultimate-goal" class="link-to-headline" aria-label="link to headline">&#x1F517;</a>Ultimate goal?</h2>
<p>In theory the ultimate goal for ally.js is to make itself obsolete because web standards and browser implementations have caught up. This isn&apos;t very likely to happen any time soon, if at all. In the meanwhile the goal is to provide all the low-level utilities required for other libraries and websites and applications to make accessible experiences an easier target. Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/medialize/ally.js/tree/master/GOALS.md">GOALS.md</a> to find out what we&apos;re planning.</p>
<h2><a id="Corporate-backing" href="#Corporate-backing" class="link-to-headline" aria-label="link to headline">&#x1F517;</a>Corporate backing?</h2>
<p>As of today ally.js does not receive official funding or guidance from anyone. The project is maintained by people volunteering their spare time.</p>
<h2><a id="Multiple-personality-disorder" href="#Multiple-personality-disorder" class="link-to-headline" aria-label="link to headline">&#x1F517;</a>Multiple personality disorder?</h2>
<p>Most of the documentation was written from a group perspective (&quot;we have done&#x2026;&quot;), but some statements are personal (&quot;I have done&quot;). I have gone with the group voice, because I hope it won&apos;t take long for others to join the project. That said, while I have <em>created</em> most of the resources so far, many people have been involved in figuring out how to do things.</p>
